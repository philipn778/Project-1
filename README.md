 # Features left to implement
* ### A working toggle button with help of java script
* ### Another feature idea

# Testing
I've been testing a lot with different sizes of pixels, percentage and more to make the screen fit all devices. I had a tough time but managed in the end to make it work by testing. 
I've also tested many different ways in how I should have my navbar in smaller screens and thought the best way was to put it in a corner with a toggle button above the links. 
I couldnt get the toggle button to work but in the next project with help of JavaScript I might fix it. 
* ### HTML

# Unfixed bugs
* ### Togglebutton on smaller device
    * I found out that I need to use JavaScript to make it work correctly, so now the button only shows. I still kept it there to make it look more sense when you're on a smaller screen. 

# Deployment
* ### The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    * In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
    * From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch.
    * Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
